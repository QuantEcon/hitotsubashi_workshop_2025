# Hitotsubashi Computational Economics Workshop

![](qe-logo-large.png)

## Abstract

Several important new scientific computing environments have appeared in recent
years, generated by demand from and investment in artificial intelligence. This
workshop will provide a brief overview of these environments and their features,
including automatic differentiation, parallel computing, and just-in-time
compilers. We will discuss how these tools might be applied to economic
applications.

## Additional Information

The workshop will include live coding exercises. Attendees who wish to follow
along should bring laptops.

If students wish to prepare for the seminar, they can install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and learn the basics of using Jupyter and Python.  The first few [QuantEcon lectures](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) might be helpful.
